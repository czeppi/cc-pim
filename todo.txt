cc-pim:
- add support for group_serials
- add support for edit task links
- solve: contact commit vs. task commit (at once or manual triggered)
- edit person or company: add support for adding address in dialog
- task-categories: add, remove, rename
- html-page: split view (for compare + preview)
- task edit dialog: change category or title => change dirname (if exists)

- Task-DB: change title from 'xxx-yyy' in 'xxx yyy' or 'xxx, yyy'
- Task: title -> dirname (remove spaces)
- context menu tasks: add function for change title (without a new revision)

refactoring:
- TaskRevision: make to dataclass
- rename cache in file_infos or something similar

bugs:
- new task => no update of words
- search for pil => unwanted line break
